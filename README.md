Code for a house drink machine I created with my roommates. 
A flask server is hosted on a Raspberry Pi that we had lying around. Any device (cell phone, or the iPad built into the machine) on the local network can connect to the server and control the machine.
The website is told which drink ingredients are loaded into the machine at the moment, the machine will then display the available drinks that can be made with the given ingredients. New drink recipes can be added into the machine at any time.
When a drink is made the Pi activates the appropriate pumps to provide the correct ratio of ingredients. The machine then activates the magnetic stirring system and voila! :)
